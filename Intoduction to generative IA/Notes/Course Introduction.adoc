= Introduction
Fundamental course for cloud computing

== Objectives
- Define generative artificial intelligence
- Define foundation models
- Discuss different cases
- Identify features and benefits of AWS

== What is Generative IA ? 
- Creation of content and ideas including:
 * stories
 * conversations
 * images
 * music

== How it differs from traditiona IA
It is a subset of machine learning 

|===
|Machine Learning                   |Generative IA 

|task based on data own data        |Pre-trained data on massive ammount 
|Sentient analysys Image class.     |Multiple tasks on same process
|Only one task with much process    |Works on patterns and relationships

== Foundation models
At is core, it hav emultiple machine learning models that includes: 
 * Text generation
 * data summarization
 * Information extraction
 * Question and answer control
 * Chatbot interaction

== Comparisson of Traditional and foundational models
